        <h3>Data silently collected</h3>
        <p>
            When you request any resource from this website (for example, a page, a font, an image, or an API endpoint)
            the requested URL (without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Structure">query string parameters</a>),
            current time, and the internal method used to handle the request is logged to the console.
            The console is limited to 1000 lines, and data sent there is never written to disk.
            The console is erased whenever the server machine restarts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sample console output:
        </p>
        <pre>[ ] [095800] Using file directly for /fonts/bariol.ttf (read)
            [ ] [095802] Using routeHandler /api/bingo/([0-9]+) to respond to /api/bingo/17
            [ ] [100031] Using pageHandler /cloudtube/subscriptions (cloudtube/subscriptions.html) to respond to /cloudtube/subscriptions
            [ ] [100031] HitAcc: 8 items updated in Hits
            [ ] [100031] HitAcc: 1 items updated in DomainHits
            [!] [100032] Couldn't handle request for /apple-touch-icon-120x120-precomposed.png
        </pre>
        <p>
            As well as being logged to console, the requested URL (without query string)
            is stored in the site's database and its hit count is incremented by one.
            The database table only stores the number of hits each resource has received.
            No information about individual requests is stored here, not even the time at which a request was made.
            This accumulated hit count is stored forever.
            You can see the first few rows of this database table here: <a href="/api/hits">/api/hits</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            A similar database table holds the number of hits each domain has received.
            Here is a static selection of rows from the table:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr><td>cadence.gq</td><td>428509</td></tr>
            <tr><td>cadence.moe</td><td>206582</td></tr>
            <tr><td>45.77.232.172</td><td>787</td></tr>
            <tr><td>www.cadence.gq</td><td>341</td></tr>
            <tr><td>www.cadence.moe</td><td>136</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            This website does not store visitor user-agent strings or IP addresses and does not use
            fingerprinting, advertisements, or tracking of any form.
