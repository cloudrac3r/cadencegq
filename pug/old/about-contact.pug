    <h1>Contact</h1>
    p.
        There are multiple ways to talk to me over the internet.
        While I'd prefer if you used email for important enquiries,
        any of these will work and I will reply as long as your
        screen name is not nasko222.
    p Online, I'm called Cadence or cloudrac3r. In real life, I'm Cadence Ember.
    p My pronouns are they/them.

            + 17.5% tax

        All of my work can be used free of charge, and most of it is open source too. Right now, I'm not paid anything
        for the time I spend coding, and server fees come out of my bank account. If you appreciate my work, please consider
        donating so that I don't have to pay for this all by myself.

    p If you use digital currencies (preferred), you can send to any of these addresses:

        BTC:             1VKob73dwZAp6Nf5WkaxgeeYgGzib3u6v
        BCH (cashaddr):  qzkevkup4qp2n6anzuw83hsa79mwe30pru7xv3jwan
        BCH (legacy):    1Gpr2CuRb56KKyqNYQnDrBXxCpw4AJ5viy
    p.
        If you have other digital currencies, I can't spend those directly, so it's best for me if you use a conversion
        service to get BCH, and send me that BCH.
